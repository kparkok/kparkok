UH Manoa Ride Share is a web application designed to address a critical challenge faced by UH Manoa students: the difficulties of campus commuting. With limited, expensive parking and sometimes inconvenient public transportation options, many students resort to driving alone, contributing to increased traffic, higher transportation costs, and elevated carbon emissions.

Our solution connects students who share similar routes and schedules, facilitating an efficient carpooling system that benefits both the community and the environment.
